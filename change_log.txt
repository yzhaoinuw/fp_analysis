#### v0.7.0
1. Got rid of the annotation box once an annotation is made. This allows the user to quickly draw smaller annotation boxes within the previous box and make annotations.
2. Kept only time and confidence in hover info box and make it 50% see-through. This reduces view blocking.
3. Removed the Autoscale button since it did the same thing as Reset Axes.
4. Added a prompt on exiting the app, which serves as a reminder to the user to save results. 
5. Added a resampling (to 512 Hz) step before feeding the EEG and EMG data to the model. The app can now handle data sampled at higher frequencies such as 610 Hz.
6. Downsampled NE to 10 Hz in visualization.
7. Added tiny gaps in the confidence heatmap, which serve as xticks.
7. Added several optimizations, such as converting serverside callbacks to clientside callbacks whenever possible, using partial property updates for callbacks on annotations. These make the app more responsive. 

#### v0.6.0
1. Added Shadi's 3-class model for sleep scoring data without NE signal.
2. Bumped up initial smapling level to at most 4,000 points, which can be further increased to 16,000 points by selecting "x4" in Sampling Level.
3. Corrected 1-second level annotation such that any annotation within a whole second, e.g., second 0-1, second 1-2, will update the sleep score for that whole second. If an annotation spans over two consecutive seconds, whichever whole second contains more annotation box will be updated. For example, the user selects an annotation box from 1.72 to 2.45 second and wants to update it to REM. Since most of the annotation box falls into the whole second 2-3, the whole second 2-3 will be updated to REM.
4. Changed keypress for annotation from 0, 1, 2, 3 to 1, 2, 3, 4, which is more convenient and intuitive.
5. Added panning by left or right arrow on keyboard. This enables the user to move left or right while in annotation mode.
6. Changed the color for MA to yellow.


#### v0.5.4
1. Added support for annotation for Micro-Arousal (MA).
2. Make the time axis always show the raw time in seconds, instead of using K for larger number. For example, always show 16455, instead of showing 16.455K.
3. Added a message telling the user what prediction file is being visualized now, in case the user lost track during annotation. The message will always above the graph when visualizing a prediction file.
4. Fixed an incorrect Undo Annotation behavior where, when an annotation does not change the current prediction, it would still be considered an annotation, and thus consuming the undo history. Now is an annotation does not change the prediction, it will not be counted in the undo history.
