v0.5.4 (added 11/10/2023)
1. **Why do the EEG, EMG, and NE signals not recover after I click *Reset*?**
A: When clicking Reset Axes after a very close up zoom-in, you may see that the signals don't recover or take a long time to recover. When this happens, simply slightly adjust the zoom level by scrolling on your mouse, after a split second, the signals should recover.

2. **Why does the sdreamer model seem to leave the last couple of seconds of my data unscored?**
A: When using the sdreamer model, you may notice that the last couple of seconds of signals unscored. But it should be no more than 64 seconds (if it is, please report to us). This is because the sdreamer model processes the signals based on 64-second sections. If the total duration of the signals cannot divide 64 evenly, there will be a leftover that's unscored. We plan to fix this issue in the next model.

3. **When zooming in or out, the upsampling of the signals is very slow to catch up.**
A: if you find the upsampling of the signals slow to catch up as you zoom in or out, try to slow down your zooming and see if that helps.

4. **Why does my annotation not work?**
A: First, check that you have selected **Box Select** above the graph on the right. Sometimes it maybe hidden. But as soon as you hover your cursor over there, it will appear. Second, make sure that the key you pressed is among the accepted keys. For example, if you are visualizing 3-class prediction results, then only **0**, **1**, and **2** are available for annotation. If it's a 4-class prediction result, then you would have the additioinal key, **3**, available. Any other keypress is ignored. Third, see if the interval you selected for annotation spans at least one second, *after rounding both your start point and end point*.

3. The annotations for micro-arousals are not yet supported. So even if you see four classes in the plots, you can only annotate 0, 1, and 2 for now. We are working on an update soon to fix this.
